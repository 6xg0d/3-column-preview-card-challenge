## My process

Pretty easy, i'm starting to get confidence with the knowledgment i'm getting! :)

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Practicing the fundamentals.

### Continued development

i'd like to set the buttons at the same position without using margins. i think isn't the best way due to responsive in different screen sizes.
